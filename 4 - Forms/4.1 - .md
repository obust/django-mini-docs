# Processing a Form

Form processing generally has 3 paths:

- Initial GET (blank or prepopulated form)
- POST with invalid data (typically redisplay form with errors)
- POST with valid data (process the data and typically redirect)

Implementing this yourself often results in a lot of repeated boilerplate code (see Using a form in a view). To help avoid this, Django provides a collection of generic class-based views for form processing.




1. Instantiate the form in the view
2. Pre-populate the form (if need be) with :
	- data from a saved model instance
	- data received from a previous HTML form submission 
	- data that we have collated from other sources
3. Pass it to the template context
4. Expand the template variable to HTML markup with DTL


Form data sent back to a page is **processed by a view**, generally the same view which published the form. This allows us to reuse some of the same logic.

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

from .forms import NameForm

def get_name(request):
    # if this is a POST request, we process the form data
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # create a form instance and populate it with data from the request:
        form = NameForm(request.POST)
        # check whether it's valid:
        if form.is_valid():
            # process the data in form.cleaned_data as required
            # ...
            # redirect to a new URL:
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/')

    # if any other method, we create a blank form
    else:
        form = NameForm()

    return render(request, 'name.html', {'form': form})
```

We now have a working web form, described by a Django Form, processed by a view, and rendered as an HTML \<form>.

## Rendering a Form

## ModelForm

Use the `ModelForm` class to _build a form from a Model class_, along with the appropriate fields and their attributes. See the [complete reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/forms/modelforms/)
