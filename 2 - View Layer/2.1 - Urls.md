# URL Configuration

See the [complete documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/) on URLs.

- URLconf & URL patterns
- Regex
- Referencing a View
- Kwargs


### Overview
Here is how Django processes a user http request :

1. Determine the root URLconf module to use (form `ROOT_URLCONF` setting)
2. Load URLconf + Look for `urlpatterns` variable 
(which is a list of url() instances)
4. Run through each URL pattern, in order, and **stops at the first one that matches the requested URL**
5. Call the given View and pass some arguments (e.g. instance of HttpRequest)

If no regex matches in the URL patterns, or if an exception is raised during any point in this process, Django invokes an appropriate [error-handling](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/#error-handling) view.

## URLconf & URL patterns
To design URLs for an app, you create URLconf file (e.g. urls.py).   
A URLconf (URL configuration) is a simple mapping between:

- Http requests (user page requests)
- URL patterns (regular expressions) 
- Views (Python functions)


### URL pattern

In a URLconf, set the `urlpatterns` variable as a list of `url()` instances.
Each `url(regex, view, [kwargs], [name])` create a URL pattern.
  
- `regex` : regular expression to compare with the url for a match
- `view` : function called for the matched regex
- `kwargs` : _k_ey_w_ord _arg_ument_s_ passed to the view as a dict
- `name` : naming the URL so you can refer to it from elsewhere

```
from django.conf.urls import url

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^articles/2003/$', views.special_case_2003),
    url(r'^articles/([0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive),
    url(r'^articles/([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/$', views.month_archive),
    url(r'^articles/([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9]+)/$', views.article_detail),
]
```

### Nested URLconfs

For a given match, it is possible to [reference another URLconf](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/#including-other-urlconfs) module. Everything that comes in from the regex match is redirected to the other URLconf and looks for further instructions there.  
This essentially “nests” hierarchically a set of URLs below other ones.

```
from django.conf.urls import include, url

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^forum/', include('my_app.forum.urls')),
    url(r'^contact/', include('my_app.contact.urls')),
]
```


## Regex

Each regular expression in a urlpatterns is **compiled the first time it’s accessed**. This makes the system **blazingly fast**.

#### Regex search

Django regex do not search GET and POST parameters. In other words, all request methods (POST, GET, HEAD, etc.) will be routed to the same function for the same URL.

E.g. for the two requests below, URLconf will only look for `myapp/`:

- `http://www.example.com/myapp/`
- `http://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3`

#### Positional arguments

Use the *non-named regex group syntax* `(pattern)` in a regex to _capture bits of the URL_ and pass them **as positional arguments** to a view.

```
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^articles/2003/$', views.special_case_2003),
    url(r'^articles/([0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive),
    url(r'^articles/([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/$', views.month_archive),
    url(r'^articles/([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9]+)/$', views.article_detail),
]
```

- A request to `/articles/2005/03/` would call the function `views.month_archive(request, '2005', '03')`.
- A request to `/articles/2005/03/10/` would call the function `views.month_archive(request, '2005', '03', '10')`.

#### Keyword arguments

Use the *named regex group syntax*  `(?P<name>pattern)` in a regex to _capture bits of the URL_ and pass them **as keyword arguments** to a view.

```
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^articles/2003/$', views.special_case_2003),
    url(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive),
    url(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/$', views.month_archive),
    url(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/(?P<day>[0-9]{2})/$', views.article_detail),
]
```

- A request to `/articles/2005/03/` would call the function `views.month_archive(request, year='2005', month='03')`.
- A request to `/articles/2005/03/10/` would call the function `views.article_detail(request, year='2003', month='03', day='10')`.

#### Nested arguments

Use the *nested regex group syntax*  `(outer(innerpattern)pattern)` in a regex to _capture nested bits of the URL_ and pass them **as arguments** to a view.

```
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'blog/(page-(\d+)/)?$', blog_articles),                  # bad
    url(r'comments/(?:page-(?P<page_number>\d+)/)?$', comments),  # good
]
```
- A request to `/blog/page-2/` would call the function `blog_articles(request, 'page-2/', '2')`.
- A request to `/comments/page-2/` would call the function `comments(request, page_number='2')`.

The outer argument in the second case is a *non-capturing regex groups syntax* `(?:pattern)`.

NB: only capture the values the view needs to work with and use non-capturing arguments when the regular expression needs an argument but the view ignores it.

#### Default arguments

Use *default arguments* in a view function to _handle default function calling_.

```
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^blog/$', views.blog),
    url(r'^blog/page(?P<num>[0-9]+)/$', views.blog),
]

# View (in blog/views.py)
def blog(request, page="1"):
    # instructions
```

- A request to `/blog/` would call the function `views.blog(request, page='1')`.
- A request to `/blog/page12/` would call the function `views.blog(request, page='12')`.

## Referencing a View

#### Function views

1. Import the module holding the view : `from myapp import views`
2. In the url(), point to the Python function of the view : `views.my_view`

```
from myapp import views

urlpattern = [
	url(r'^$', views.my_view)
]
```

#### Class-based views

1. Import the class of the view : `from myapp.views import MyView `
2. In the url(), call the `.as_view()` method on the class of the view : `MyView.as_view()`

```
from myapp.views import MyView

urlpattern = [
	url(r'^$', MyView.as_view())
]
```

## Kwargs

Use a **dictionnary of keyword arguments** to _pass extra arguments to the view_.

```
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^blog/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive, {'foo': 'bar'}),
]
```
- A request to `/blog/2005/` would call the function `views.year_archive(request, year='2005', foo='bar')`.

NB: similarly, kwargs can be passed as extra agruments to a nested URLconf (when using include()).

## Name

Use **named URL patterns** to _perform URL reversing_.

This DRY mechanism allow evolution of the URL design without having to go over all the project source code to search and replace outdated URLs.

##### URLconf example

```
from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    #...
    url(r'^articles/([0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive, name='news-year-archive'),
    #...
]
```

##### Reverse URL in a Template

```
<a href="{% url 'news-year-archive' 2012 %}">2012 Archive</a>
{# Or with the year in a template context variable: #}
<ul>
{% for yearvar in year_list %}
<li><a href="{% url 'news-year-archive' yearvar %}">{{ yearvar }} Archive</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

##### Reverse URL in Python code

```
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

def redirect_to_year(request):
    # ...
    year = 2006
    # ...
    return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('news-year-archive', args=(year,)))
```
